# Rclone_clone
In this project, I have prepared an amateur copy of an application called Rclone, which makes it easy to upload files and folders to Dropbox without exceeding 150mb in size and allows you to run and synchronize the project with the - //sync command when changes are made to files on your computer.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Before running the project, change the name of the file named .env_rename to .env and enter your dropbox and host information in it.
